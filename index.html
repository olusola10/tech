                          I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior <br> knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks, <br> I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also <br> master the soft skills required for being a software developer.
    
                          So far so good, <br> the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my career as a software developer. <br>

                        Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get <br> in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really <br> different from the self learning I started with. The learning was <br> fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were <br> presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program. <br>
    
                                 Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed. <br>
